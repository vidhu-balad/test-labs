# Lab 1: Get Ready with Kosli

## Learning Goals

- Create a Kosli account
- Fork and set up the sample application repository
- Verify that the CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- Understand the basic structure of the application and its deployment process

## Introduction

Welcome to the first lab!

Before diving into Kosli's features, you need to set up your account and verify that your sample application builds and deploys correctly.

This lab uses a simple [Java Micronaut application](app) with a complete CI/CD pipeline already configured in GitHub Actions. The pipeline builds the application, creates a Docker image, runs tests, and deploys it.

In subsequent labs, you'll integrate Kosli to track all these activities.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Understanding of CI/CD concepts
- A web browser

## Exercise

### Overview

In this lab, you will:

- Create a free Kosli account
- Fork the labs repository to your GitHub account
- Enable GitHub Actions on your forked repository
- Verify that the pipeline runs successfully and produces artifacts
- Observe the application deployment process

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Create a Kosli account

- Navigate to [kosli.com/sign-up]<https://app.kosli.com/sign-up>)
- Choose to sign up with GitHub
- Complete the registration process
- Verify your email address if required
- Log in to [https://app.kosli.com](https://app.kosli.com)

So far so good :tada:. We will go a lot more in detail with Kosli in the next sections, but for now we need the scaffolding set up.

#### Make a copy of the repository

- Navigate to the labs repositorys main page (the repository you're currently viewing)
- Click the "Use this template" button in the top-right corner of the page
- Select your personal GitHub account as the destination
- Wait for GitHub to complete the copy process
- You should now have a copy at `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/labs`

> :bulb: From now on the term "your repository" will mean your copy of the labs repository.

#### Enable GitHub Actions and configure secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. If prompted, click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
4. The workflow should start automatically, if not, you can trigger it manually:
   - Click on "Main workflow" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Run workflow" button on the right
   - Select the branch (usually `main`) and click "Run workflow"

#### Verify the pipeline execution

- In the "Actions" tab, click on the most recent workflow run
- Observe the workflow jobs:
  - **Build**: Compiles the Java application using Gradle
  - **Linting**: Checks code quality (may show warnings)
  - **Docker-image**: Builds and pushes a Docker container image
  - **Security-scan**: Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities
  - **Component-test**: Runs integration tests
  - **Performance-test**: Runs basic performance checks
  - **Deploy**: Starts and stops the application container
- Wait for all jobs to complete (green checkmarks)

- If any jobs fail, review the logs to understand what went wrong

> :bulb: The pipeline might take 3-6 minutes to complete on the first run. GitHub Actions provides free minutes for public repositories.

<details>
<summary>:bulb: Common issues</summary>

- **Docker-image job fails with permission error**: Make sure your repository has package write permissions enabled
- **Linting shows warnings**: This is expected and won't fail the build (DISABLE_ERRORS is set to true)

</details>

#### Explore the GitHub Actions workflow

1. In your repository, navigate to `.github/workflows/full-pipeline.yaml`
2. Review the workflow structure:
   - Notice how it's triggered on every push
   - Observe the environment variables set at the top
   - See how artifacts are shared between jobs using `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact`
   - Note the dependencies between jobs (e.g., Docker-image needs Build)
3. In later labs, you'll add Kosli integration to this pipeline

#### View the Docker image

1. Go to your GitHub profile page
2. Click on "Packages" tab
3. You should see the `labs` package
4. Click on it to view details about the Docker image
5. Note the image tag (usually `latest`) and the SHA digest

> :bulb: The Docker image is automatically published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) by the pipeline.

### Verification Checklist

Before moving to the next lab, ensure you have:

- ✅ A Kosli account at app.kosli.com with an organization created
- ✅ A forked copy of the labs repository under your GitHub account
- ✅ GitHub Actions successfully completed all jobs in the workflow
- ✅ A Docker image published to your GitHub Container Registry
- ✅ Understanding of the basic pipeline structure

### Clean up

No cleanup is required for this lab. The deployed container is automatically stopped by the pipeline's Deploy job.

## Next Steps

In [Lab 2: Flows and Trails](lab-02-flows-and-trails.md), you'll learn how to install the Kosli CLI, create flows and trails, and start integrating Kosli into your CI/CD pipeline.
