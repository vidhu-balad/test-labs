# Lab 2: Flows and Trails

## Learning Goals

- Install and configure the Kosli CLI on your local machine or GitHub Codespace
- Create and configure an API key for Kosli authentication
- Understand the concepts of Flows and Trails in Kosli
- Create your first Flow using the Kosli CLI
- Begin a Trail manually to track a process execution
- Integrate Flow and Trail creation into your CI/CD workflow

## Introduction

Now is the time to dig into the world of Kosli.

Kosli uses **Flows** and **Trails** to organize and track your software delivery processes:

- A **Flow** represents a repeatable business or software process (like your CI/CD pipeline). It defines what you want to track and what compliance requirements must be met.
- A **Trail** represents a single execution instance of that Flow. For example, each git commit or pull request creates a new Trail that tracks all activities for that specific change.

Think of a Flow as a template for your process, and Trails as the individual instances where you record what actually happened.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Lab 1: Get Ready](lab-01-get-ready.md)
- A Kosli account
- Your forked labs repository
- Command line access (local terminal or GitHub Codespace)

## Exercise

### Overview

In this lab, you will:

- Install the Kosli CLI tool
- Generate an API key for authentication
- Create a Kosli Flow to represent your CI/CD pipeline
- Begin a Trail manually using a git commit as the identifier
- Create shell scripts to integrate Flow and Trail management into your GitHub Actions workflow
- Verify the Flow and Trail appear in the Kosli web interface

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Install the Kosli CLI

You can download the correct Kosli CLI for your platform, given that you can run shell scripts on it, by invoking this one-line script:

```bash
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosli-dev/cli/refs/heads/main/install-cli.sh | sh

# Verify installation
kosli version
```

> :bulb: if this installation method fails, we have other, head over to the [install section of the docs](https://docs.kosli.com/getting_started/install/#part-2-install-kosli-cli) to learn more.

#### Create a Kosli API Key

- Log in to [https://app.kosli.com/settings/profile](https://app.kosli.com/settings/profile)
- Navigate to the "API Keys" section
- Click "Add API Key"
- Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "CLI Access" or "Local Development")
- Copy the generated API key immediately (it won't be shown again)
- Paste it in somewhere you can get it again during these labs, you might need it several times.

**Configure the API key for CLI use:**

<details>
<summary>Bash</summary>

```bash
# Set environment variables
export KOSLI_API_TOKEN="your-api-key-here"
export KOSLI_ORG="your-gh-username"
```

</details>

See [Kosli Authentication](https://docs.kosli.com/getting_started/install/#assigning-flags-via-environment-variables) for more details.

#### Create a Flow manually

First, let's create a Flow manually to understand the concept:

```bash
# Create a Flow with an empty template
kosli create flow labs-pipeline \
  --description "CI/CD pipeline for labs application" \
  --use-empty-template

# Verify the Flow was created
kosli get flow labs-pipeline
```

You should see something like the following returned:

```bash
Name:                labs-pipeline
Description:         CI/CD pipeline for labs application
Visibility:          private
Template:            
                     version: 1
Last Deployment At:  N/A
Tags:                None
```

> :bulb: The `--use-empty-template` flag creates a Flow without compliance requirements. In Lab 3, you'll learn how to add a template with specific attestation requirements.

Visit [app.kosli.com](https://app.kosli.com) and navigate to Flows to see your newly created Flow.

See [kosli create flow](https://docs.kosli.com/client_reference/kosli_create_flow/) for more details.

#### Begin a Trail manually

A Trail represents one execution of your process. Let's create a Trail using your latest git commit:

```bash
# Begin a Trail using the current git commit SHA
kosli begin trail $(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  --flow labs-pipeline \
  --description "Manual trail for testing"

# Verify the Trail was created
kosli get trail $(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  --flow labs-pipeline
```

The Trail name is the git commit SHA, which uniquely identifies this execution. This allows Kosli to connect all activities (builds, tests, deployments) that happen for this specific commit.

> :bulb: You can use any naming scheme for Trails (commit SHA, PR number, Jira ticket, etc.). Git commits are common because they're unique and tied to your source code.

- Go to Kosli to see your new trail under your Flow called "labs-pipeline"

![first trail](img\first-trail.png)

See [kosli begin trail](https://docs.kosli.com/client_reference/kosli_begin_trail/) for more details and [Flows documentation](https://docs.kosli.com/getting_started/flows/) and [Trails documentation](https://docs.kosli.com/getting_started/trails/) for conceptual understanding.

#### Immutable trails

Everything in a trail inside Kosli is immutable, with append-only as the strategy for updates.
This is important in a compliance setting where the ability to change in data is equal to the risk of tampering with said data.

To explore this feature, let's go back and begin the same trail once more.

```bash
kosli begin trail $(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  --flow labs-pipeline \
  --description "Manual trail for testing."
```

If this had been a mutable trail, the description would have been updated with a dot at the end, and no record of the change would have been. But try now to do the get trail once more.

```bash
kosli get trail $(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  --flow labs-pipeline
```

The result should look like the following:

```bash
Name:              df029fec81ae14bd9dc98ce365c4d2d92d5c32ac
Description:       Manual trail for testing.
Compliance:        COMPLIANT
Last modified at:  Wed, 26 Nov 2025 21:14:33 CET • 44 seconds ago
Events:

     TIME                           DESCRIPTION    GIT-COMMIT  COMPLIANCE
     Wed, 26 Nov 2025 21:13:09 CET  trail started
     Wed, 26 Nov 2025 21:14:33 CET  trail updated
```

You see here that every time a new event is happening in the trail, we append that to the trail for auditability purposes.

#### Integrate Kosli into your CI/CD pipeline

Now let's integrate Flow and Trail creation into your CI/CD pipeline.

**Add API key as a GitHub Secret:**

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `KOSLI_API_TOKEN`
5. Value: Your Kosli API key
6. Click "Variables"
7. Click "New repository variable"
8. Repeat for `KOSLI_ORG` with your organization name

> :bulb: Never commit API keys to your repository via Git. Always use environment variables or secrets management.

#### Update GitHub Actions workflow

We will update the workflow file `.github/workflows/full-pipeline.yaml` to include Kosli commands directly.

**1. Add global environment variables**

To avoid repeating the Kosli credentials in every step, add them as global environment variables at the top of your workflow file:

```yaml
env:
  KOSLI_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KOSLI_API_TOKEN }}
  KOSLI_ORG: ${{ vars.KOSLI_ORG }}
  # ... other existing env vars ...
```

**2. Add Kosli steps**

Add the following steps to your workflow. Place them just after checking out the code.

```yaml
      - name: Clone down repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
  #Your new additions
      - name: Setup Kosli CLI
        uses: kosli-dev/setup-cli-action@v2
        with:
          version:
            latest

      - name: Create/Update Flow
        run: |
          kosli create flow ${APP_NAME}-pipeline \
            --description "CI/CD pipeline for ${APP_NAME} application" \
            --use-empty-template

      - name: Begin Trail
        run: |
          kosli begin trail ${GIT_COMMIT} \
            --flow ${APP_NAME}-pipeline \
            --description "Build ${BUILD_NUMBER}: ${GIT_BRANCH}"
```

> :bulb: We use the `kosli-dev/setup-cli-action` to install the CLI. The `env` variables we set earlier ensure the CLI is authenticated.

#### Test the integration

1. Commit the changes to your workflow file:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/full-pipeline.yaml
git commit -m "Add Kosli Flow and Trail steps"
git push origin main
```

2. Go to GitHub Actions and watch the workflow run
3. Verify the "Update Flow" and "Kosli start trail" steps complete successfully
4. Check the logs to see the Kosli CLI output
5. Visit [app.kosli.com](https://app.kosli.com) and navigate to your Flow
6. You should see a new Trail corresponding to your commit

> :bulb: Each push to your repository will now create a new Trail, allowing you to track the complete history of your pipeline executions.

### Verification Checklist

Before moving to the next lab, ensure you have:

- ✅ Kosli CLI installed and can run `kosli version`
- ✅ API key created and configured as environment variables
- ✅ API key and organization name added as GitHub Secrets and variables
- ✅ Successfully created a Flow manually using the CLI
- ✅ Successfully created a Trail manually using a git commit SHA
- ✅ Updated workflow with Kosli steps
- ✅ Workflow runs successfully with Flow and Trail creation
- ✅ Can see the Flow and Trails in the Kosli web interface

### Clean up

No cleanup is required for this lab. Flows and Trails remain in Kosli for historical tracking and audit purposes.

## Next Steps

In [Lab 3: Build Controls and Attestations](lab-03-build-controls.md), you'll learn how to attest artifacts and attach evidence like test results, SBOMs, and security scans to your Trails.
